## Statement
ABC Food Mart required an advanced data management system to enhance operational efficiency and support strategic decision-making through improved data analytics capabilities.

## Proposal
I proposed the development of a comprehensive PostgreSQL database that would efficiently store and manage critical business data such as sales, inventory, and customer information. This included:

Designing a relational database schema to ensure data integrity and facilitate complex queries.
Developing optimized SQL queries to manage and analyze data effectively

## Conclusion
My contributions to developing the SQL components of ABC Food Mart's data management system have significantly enhanced the company's ability to perform detailed data analyses and make informed strategic decisions. This project not only improved data handling efficiency but also ensured that the database system could scale with the company's growth.
